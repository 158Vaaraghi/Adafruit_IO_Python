# Example of using the MQTT client class to subscribe to and publish feed values.
# Author: Tony DiCola

# Import standard python modules.
import random
import sys
import time

# Import Adafruit IO MQTT client.
from Adafruit_IO import MQTTClient

# Set to your Adafruit IO key.
# Remember, your key is a secret,
# so make sure not to publish it when you publish this code!
ADAFRUIT_IO_KEY = 'YOUR_AIO_KEY'

# Set to your Adafruit IO username.
# (go to https://accounts.adafruit.com to find your username)
ADAFRUIT_IO_USERNAME = 'YOUR_AIO_USERNAME'

# name of the group to subscribe to changes on
group_name = 'grouptest'

# Define callback functions which will be called when certain events happen.
def connected(client):
    # Connected function will be called when the client is connected to Adafruit IO.
    # This is a good place to subscribe to feed changes.  The client parameter
    # passed to this function is the Adafruit IO MQTT client so you can make
    # calls against it easily.
    # Subscribe to changes on a group_id.
    print('Subscribing to ', group_name)
    client.subscribe_group(group_name)

def disconnected(client):
    # Disconnected function will be called when the client disconnects.
    print('Disconnected from Adafruit IO!')
    sys.exit(1)

def message(client, topic_id, payload):
    # Message function will be called when a subscribed topic has a new value.
    # The topic_id parameter identifies the topic, and the payload parameter has
    # the new value.
    print('{0} received new value: {1}'.format(topic_id, payload))


# Create an MQTT client instance.
client = MQTTClient(ADAFRUIT_IO_USERNAME, ADAFRUIT_IO_KEY)

# Setup the callback functions defined above.
client.on_connect    = connected
client.on_disconnect = disconnected
client.on_message    = message

# Connect to the Adafruit IO server.
client.connect()

# Run a message loop forever to listen
client.loop_blocking()
